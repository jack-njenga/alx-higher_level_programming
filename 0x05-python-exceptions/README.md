# Python - Exceptions 
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), without the help of Google:

- What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
- What are exceptions and how to use them
- When do we need to use exceptions
- How to correctly handle an exception
- What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
- How to raise a builtin exception
- When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Tasks

- [x] 1-safe_print_integer.py - Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().
- [x] 2-safe_print_list_integers.py - Write a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.
- [x] 3-safe_print_division.py - Write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.
- [x] 4-list_division.py - Write a function that divides element by element 2 lists.

- [x] 6-raise_exception_msg.py - Write a function that raises a name exception with a message.
- [x] 100-safe_print_integer_err.py - Write a function that prints an integer.
- [x] 101-safe_function.py - Write a function that executes a function safely.
- [ ] 102-magic_calculation.py - Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode: "its too long tobe displayed"
